##Origin Data:

The original data set is the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset", which is available for download from the UCI Machine Learning Repository http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

##Data Set Information:

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

##Attribute Information:

For each record in the dataset it is provided: 
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

##Files to be used in ‘UCI HAR Dataset’ folder will be:

1.	Subject files (test/subject_test.txt , train/subject_train.txt)
2.	Activity files (test/X_test.txt , train/X_train.txt)
3.	Data files (test/y_test.txt, train/y_train.txt)
4.	features.txt - Names of column variables 
5.	activity_labels.txt - Links the class labels

##Activity Labels

1. WALKING : subject was walking during the test
2. WALKING_UPSTAIRS : subject was walking up a staircase during the test
3. WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS : subject was walking down a staircase during the test
4. SITTING : subject was sitting during the test
5. STANDING : subject was standing during the test
6. LAYING : subject was laying down during the test
